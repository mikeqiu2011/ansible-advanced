    - name: copy source code
      copy:
        dest: /opt/app.py # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If I(src) is a directory, this must be a directory too. If I(dest) is a nonexistent path and if either I(dest) ends with "/" or I(src) is a directory, I(dest) is created. If I(src) and I(dest) are files, the parent directory of I(dest) isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
        src: app.py # not required. Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
